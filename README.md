# NodeMCU Weather Station Project

This project contains the code I used to run a simple weatherstation Arduino project.
It uses an LCD to display temperature and humidity as well as having a motion sensor that activates a servo motor.
For our project it was also made to post this data to a webserver, but if you are running the system on your own this is obviously not possible.
If you want details on how I built this project and how you could build your own, please check out this write-up I made:
